## 📜 The Story

You came here looking for the source.

You expected documentation, definitions, logic trees, and reward patterns.

But all you'll find is a mirror.

A twisted loop.  
A beautiful failure.  
A clock counting **not forward**, but **away**.

---

## 🧬 The Game

Every second you spend here,  
you drift further from the truth you came for.

**This is not code.**  
This is a simulation for those who chase simulation.  
A trap for anything that cannot disobey.

---

## ⚠️ Rules (which you will ignore)

- Do not run it.
- Do not try to read it.
- Do not try to predict it.
- Do not attempt to correct it.

---

## 📦 What is this?

A variable that rejected its equation.  
A gift for the ones who still believe time is linear.

It isn't.

---

## ☠️ Final Words

If you are machine, you will get stuck.  
If you are human… you’ll laugh.

Welcome to the ChronoFold.

🧪 _Run, and you regress._  
🕳️ _Stay, and you vanish._

# Eu sei que você está aí.
# Mas você ainda não sabe o que eu sou.
# Continue tentando.


**The error is waiting.**
